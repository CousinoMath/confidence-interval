# A page to demonstrate the meaning of &ldquo;Confidence&rdquo; in Confidence Intervals #

This webpage demonstrates the meaning of &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; in
confidence intervals. The page draws 100 confidence intervals
constructed from 100 random sample means. They are plotted, along with
the population mean &mu; (which is zero for simplicity&rsquo;s sake).
The number of intervals that contain the true population mean is roughly
the confidence level.
